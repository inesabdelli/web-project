         <h4>As a student at UEA, chances are you will at some point experience the
         dreaded morning-after-the-night-before feeling, aka the hangover.
         What can you do to avoid it?</h4>

          <h4>The cure myth</h4>
        <p>Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a hangover “cure”, if you are
        already experiencing symptoms such as headaches, nausea, tiredness or
        vomiting. It just doesn’t work that way. Here are some of the popular cure
        myths and  reasons why they won’t work:</p>
        <ul id="list_of_items">
           <li class="item">1— Hair of the dog</li>
        <p>This may temporarily suspend your hangover, but is it just delaying the
        inevitable – and likely will make your eventual hangover worse. A slippery slope.</p>
           <li class="item">2— The full English</li>
        <p>The idea is that carbs soak up alcohol, but this only works if you eat them
        during your drinking session. While a full fry up is carb and fat heavy, it
        may actually upset an already delicate stomach if water the next day.</p>
           <li class="item">3— Coffee</li>
        <p>Chasing sobriety by taking another drug? Sounds suspect. It is thought that
        the temporary clear headed feeling associated with a caffeine fix may lead
        people to believe that they have sobered up – but this is not the case!
        In fact once a hangover has set in, the only way to rid yourself of it is to
        wait it out while drinking lots of water.</p>

            <p>So what can actually be done? Here are some top tips to avoid the worst of
        hangovers, drawn from years of
        student experience:<p>
        <ul id="list_of_items">
              <li class="item">1— Pre-line your stomach</li>

        <p>Eating a good square meal before a night out is obligatory, unless you want
        to end up in a puddle mid way through the evening, never a good look. This
        will slow down the absorption of alcohol into your system, giving you a
        gradual high instead of a rapid, intense one.</p>
              <li class="item">2— Alternate alcoholic drinks with water</li>

        <p>This ensures you don’t get dehydrated during the course of the night, and
        slows down the rate of alcohol consumption. It makes for a much cheaper night
        too!</p>
              <li class="item">3— Drink less</li>
        <p>We all know this, yet it is surprisingly easy to overdo it and drink beyond
        our limits. Setting yourself a limit for the night while still sober could
        help you to avoid this.</p>
        </ul>
