 <h3> How to deal with winter blues </h3>
 <p>Winter blues has become increasingly common and, at University, most of us feel already homesick craving Sunday Roast. First of all, to know if you have winter blues? There is this useful article on the NHS website and there are several events organised by the Dean of Students and UEA’s Student Union to provide you with support !
   <ul id="list_of_items">
       <li class="item">1— Speak about it to someone.</li>

 <p> Although you may think you are alone, you are not in this just by yourself! Whether it is your friends or the support provided by the University, make sure you speak to someone about it.


       <li class="item">2— “Get active to stop being SAD” said Dr Andrew McCulloch former chief executive of the Mental Health Foundation.</li>

 <p>Exercising can help you change your mind and feel less stressed. McCulloch said “There’s convincing evidence that 30 minutes of vigorous exercise three times a week is effective against depression and anecdotal evidence that lighter exercise will have a beneficial effect, too. If you have a tendency towards SAD, outdoor exercise will have a double benefit, because you’ll gain some daylight.</p>
 Even a short 30-minute walk in the morning can help you in the long run.</p>


       <li class="item">3— Check the University website !</li>

 <p>The university has ongoing events and workshops to help you. Make sure to go there, it will be a great opportunity to meet people feeling the same and to speak to staff about your concerns.</p>


       <li class="item">4— Nightline </li>
 <p>If you do not feel like speaking about it to University staff try trained volunteers students. You can call helpline anytime if you have any issues. </p>
 </ul>

 <h3>Hangover Cures</h3>

 <p>As a student at UEA, chances are you will at some point experience the
 dreaded morning-after-the-night-before feeling, aka the hangover.
 What can you do to avoid it?</p>

  <h4>The cure myth</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a hangover “cure”, if you are
already experiencing symptoms such as headaches, nausea, tiredness or
vomiting. It just doesn’t work that way. Here are some of the popular cure
myths and  reasons why they won’t work:</p>
<ul id="list_of_items">
   <li class="item">1— Hair of the dog</li>
<p>This may temporarily suspend your hangover, but is it just delaying the
inevitable – and likely will make your eventual hangover worse. A slippery slope.</p>
   <li class="item">2— The full English</li>
<p>The idea is that carbs soak up alcohol, but this only works if you eat them
during your drinking session. While a full fry up is carb and fat heavy, it
may actually upset an already delicate stomach if water the next day.</p>
   <li class="item">3— Coffee</li>
<p>Chasing sobriety by taking another drug? Sounds suspect. It is thought that
the temporary clear headed feeling associated with a caffeine fix may lead
people to believe that they have sobered up – but this is not the case!
In fact once a hangover has set in, the only way to rid yourself of it is to
wait it out while drinking lots of water.</p>

    <p>So what can actually be done? Here are some top tips to avoid the worst of
hangovers, drawn from years of
student experience:<p>
<ul id="list_of_items">
      <li class="item">1— Pre-line your stomach</li>

<p>Eating a good square meal before a night out is obligatory, unless you want
to end up in a puddle mid way through the evening, never a good look. This
will slow down the absorption of alcohol into your system, giving you a
gradual high instead of a rapid, intense one.</p>
      <li class="item">2— Alternate alcoholic drinks with water</li>

<p>This ensures you don’t get dehydrated during the course of the night, and
slows down the rate of alcohol consumption. It makes for a much cheaper night
too!</p>
      <li class="item">3— Drink less</li>
<p>We all know this, yet it is surprisingly easy to overdo it and drink beyond
our limits. Setting yourself a limit for the night while still sober could
help you to avoid this.</p>

    <h3> Things to do With your parents when they come to visit!</h3>

     <p>Parents planning a visit and you don’t know where to take them because
       you don’t know Norwich well enough? Never fear because we have made a few
        plans that you could cater to budget and interest!!!</p>
        <h4>The city trip</h4>
        <p> Start your day early grabbing breakfast at Storm in Teacup, they
          make a good selection of breakfast, including a full and a light
          English breakfast crafted with locally sourced ingredients.
Next walk off your breakfast on the way to Norwich Cathedral where you can
explore this ancient building and its grounds. From there you can walk back into
 town and explore the market and castle! There is an entire museum and gallery
 in the castle that you can visit, or you can just admire the beautiful city
 views.
There are several independent cafés and tea rooms in Norwich that you can go to
 for a quick drink and slice of cake. Biddy’s tearoom is like wonderland for tea
  lovers, while KindaKafe serves cheap healthy food and has a pay it forward
  scheme so that you can support people in need. Mustard coffee bar is situated
   where the original Coleman’s mustard shop once stood.
If you are looking to indulge in some retail therapy Jarrolds (Norwich’s answer
to Harrods) will easily be able to satisfy. If by the evening you need some
entertainment then it’s always a good idea to see what’s on in the theatre-
 Norwich has three! Maddermarket theatre, Theatre Royal and the Playhouse; each
  caters to different tastes. If cinema is more your style there are three of
  those too! Cinema City, Vue and Odeon.
After a long day out it’s important to fill up on some delicious food.
St Benedict’s street is known for its restaurants, but you should also consider,
 North, Namaste India/ Namaste Village, The Giggling Squid,
 Norwich rooftop gardens, The Grosvenor fish bar, The Belgian Monk,
 The Last Wine bar, Roger Hickman’s and St Andrew’s Brewhouse.
 This is just a short list of places you might want to try, but there is a huge
 selection in the city to cater to all tastes.</p>

 <h4>If your parents need accommodation for their stay they can find it in this
    handy list!</h4>
