<h1> How to deal with winter blues </h1>
<p>Winter blues has become increasing common and at University most of us feel already homesick craving that Sunday Roast. First of all, to know if you have winter blues, there is this useful article on the NHS website and there are several events organised by the Dean of Students and UEA’s Student Union to provide you with support !
  <ul id="list_of_items">
      <li class="item_1">1— Speak about it to someone.</li>

<p> Although you may think you are alone, you are not in this just by yourself! Whether it is your friends or the support provided by the University, make sure you speak to someone about it.


      <li class="item_2">2— “Get active to stop being SAD” said Dr Andrew McCulloch former chief executive of the Mental Health Foundation.</li>

<p>Exercising can help you change your mind and feel less stressed. McCulloch said “There’s convincing evidence that 30 minutes of vigorous exercise three times a week is effective against depression and anecdotal evidence that lighter exercise will have a beneficial effect, too. If you have a tendency towards SAD, outdoor exercise will have a double benefit, because you’ll gain some daylight.</p>
Even a short 30-minute walk in the morning can help you in the long run.</p>


      <li class="item_3">3— Check the University website !</li>

<p>The university has ongoing events and workshops to help you. Make sure to go there, it will be a great opportunity to meet people feeling the same and to speak to staff about your concerns.</p>


      <li class="item_4">4— Nightline </li>
<p>If you do not feel like speaking about it to University staff try trained volunteers students. You can call helpline anytime if you have any issues. </p>
</ul>
